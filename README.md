# CSC 442 Project 2: Block World
### Dylan Jager-Kujawa and Matt Richardson
---

Project 2 serves to create and implement a language using a context-free grammar. The language is interpreted using three programs: 
 - the scanner, which reads the input programs and returns a sequence of tokens
 - the parser, which reads the tokens, generates symbol and constant tables, an error table (if necessary), and returns an intermediate language, similar to assembly
 - the interpreter, which takes the intermediate code and runs through it line-by-line
If at any point an error is encountered, the current program stops and does not pass along its input to the next stage of compilation. It would not make sense to try and interpret code that has not been parsed properly; similarly, it would not make sense to parse a program containing unexpected/unhandled tokens.

## Status:
Currently, a roughly working version of the scanner has been written, although it is not the best looking code in terms of documentation and cosmetics. Not all features of the scanner have been implemented yet, however it has been tested and verified to return the given program's tokens correctly (it does not split single tokens into multiple or combine multiple tokens into one).

No work has been done on the parser or the interpreter to date.

The language was changed from java to C++ in order to implement a Makefile, which will allow Dr. Strader to quickly and easily compile the code with all the same flags. This also makes documentation easier, as instructions for how to run are essentially
```
make
blocks input
```

<a name="todo" />
## To Do:
 - [x] ~~Write Scanner~~
 - [ ] Add comment recognition to Scanner
 - [ ] Test Scanner
 - [ ] Write Parser
 - [ ] Test Parser
 - [ ] Write Interpreter
 - [ ] Test sample programs/error checking
 - [ ] Write/Maintain debug code throughout all classes! (Ongoing)

<a name="cfg" />
## Context-Free Grammar:
```
<program> ::= WORLD <variable>: BLOCKS { <declarations> }; MOVES [ <actions> ];
<declarations> ::= {<variable>;}* <arm>;
<actions> ::= <action>; {<action>;}*
<variable> ::= <id> ( <coordinate> )
<arm> ::= arm ( <coordinate> ) | arm ()
<coordinate> ::= <location>, <location>
<location> ::= <nonzero> {<digit>}*
<id> ::= <alpha> {<alpha>|<digit>}*
<alpha> ::= a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z
<nonzero> ::= 1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
<digit> ::= 0|<nonzero>
<action> ::= GRAB ( {<coordinate>|<id>} ) | UNSTACK ( {<coordinate>|<id>} ) | 
  MOVE ( <coordinate> ) | DROP | STACK | PRINT
<eolcomment> ::= //
<startcomment> ::= /*
<endcomment> ::= */
```

## Syntax Overview
<a name="comments"/>
### Comments
Block World uses c-style comments:  
```
// This is an inline comment.
/*
  This is a
  multi-line
  comment
*/
```  
Note that nested comments are not supported.

<a name="layout" />
### Program Layout
Block World programs are divided into three sections:
 1. The world declaration, wherein the world is named and given dimensions
 2. The block declaratons, wherein all block objects are declared and initialized
 3. The move commands, which control the robot arm to move blocks between locations.  
The structure is roughly as follows:  
```
WORLD id(#,#):
BLOCKS { ... };
MOVES [ ... ];
```
As you will see in the examples below, Blocks World uses the braces and punctuation to differentiate various parts of code; new lines are ignored. For example, the one-line `MOVES [ ... ];` statement above can be rewritten as  
```
MOVES [
...
];
``` 
or even
```
MOVES
[
...
];
```  
Similarly, tabs and indentation are ignored, and are purely for cosmetic purposes. By convention, all declarations and statements within `BLOCKS{};` or `MOVES[];` statements should be indented one tab, to indicate that they fall within that program block's domain.

<a name="block" />
### Block Declarations
All blocks are declared using an id, which is any string beginning with a letter, followed by one or more alphanumeric characters. Following the id is the initial location of the block, written as a coordinate, for example, `(1,2)`. Coordinates are numbered from 1 to the size of the specified dimension. Finally, the declaration ends with a semicolon. See the sample program below for examples.

The last declaration in the `BLOCKS` section must be `arm()`. Note that by default, arm starts at location `(1,1)`. However, an initial location for arm may also be declared by supplying a coordinate instead of the empty parentheses, e.g. `arm(2,3);`.

<a name="moves" />
### Move Commands
Block World supports the following actions:
 - MOVE ( coordinate );
 - GRAB ( coordinate or id );
 - UNSTACK ( coordinate or id );
 - DROP;
 - STACK;
 - PRINT;
 Note that the Block World interpreter will automatically output the initial and final positions of all blocks, in addition to the relevant compilation or debugging output (if desired).

<a name="program" />
## Sample Program:
```
WORLD proj2(5,5):
BLOCKS {
	var1(1,1);
	var2(1,2);
	var3(2,4);
	arm();
};
MOVES [
	MOVE(1,1);
  GRAB(var1);
	MOVE(2,2);
	DROP;
	MOVE(1,2);
  GRAB(var2);
  MOVE(2,2);
  STACK;
	//Errors:
	UNSTACK(var1); //ERROR: var 1 not at top of stack
	MOVE(6,5);     //ERROR: (6,5) not located within proj2
	DROP;          //ERROR: not holding anything
];
```

<a name="output" />
## Sample Output (from code above excluding errors):
```
Initial position:
    # blocks / location:
           1  2  3  4  5
        1  1  1  _  _  _
        2  _  _  _  1  _
        3  _  _  _  _  _
        4  _  _  _  _  _
        5  _  _  _  _  _
    Location contents:
      (1,1):
          var1
      (1,2):
          var2
      (2,4):
          var3

Final position:
    # blocks / location:
           1  2  3  4  5
